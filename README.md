# Fork Environment
This repository will be following a fork structure, meaning that fellows will **commit to their own local respository** while **pulling new weekly content from this one upstream**. Weekly content will be updated on the master branch, but a copy of all previous week's content will be available via branches.

**Note: From now on we will be referring to the tpeo/full-stack-learning-repo-fall-2021 project as the **main** repo and your individual repository as the **forked** repo. 
## Forking the Repository 
Navigate to a directory where you'd like to keep all your projects. If you haven't already, we would recommend creating a folder like ```GitHub_Projects``` or ```TPEO```.
1. Go onto the **main** repository's Github page and click the **Fork** button
2. Clone the repository locally in your project folder of choice by performing 
    ``` 
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
3. We need to set the **forked** repo's upstream url, allowing you to pull changes from the **main**, perform
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/tpeo/full-stack-learning-repo-fall-2021.git
    ```
4. Verify that the forked repo has the following remote properties by performing ```git remote -v```
    ```
    $ git remote -v
    > origin    https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>/full-stack-learning-repo-fall-2021.git (fetch)
    > origin    https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_NAME>/full-stack-learning-repo-fall-2021.git(push)
    > upstream  https://github.com/tpeo/full-stack-learning-repo-fall-2021.git (fetch)
    > upstream  https://github.com/tpeo/full-stack-learning-repo-fall-2021.git (push)
    ```
## Commiting Changes To the Forked Repository

1. Add files 
    ``` 
    git add <files> 
    ``` 
2. Commit changes
    ```
    git commit -m"<YOUR MESSAGE HERE>"
    ```
3. Push
    ```
    git push origin main 
    ```
## Pulling Changes From Main Repository
You should pull approximately every week when new content arrives. These steps will involve merging the main repository's ```main``` branch with a forked repository's ```main``` branch 
1. Make sure you are on the appropriate branch
    ```
    git checkout main  
    ```
2. Fetch Content from Main Repository
    ```
    git fetch upstream
    ```
3. Merge Upstream with current local branch
    ```
    git merge upstream/main
    ```

## Suggesting Changes to the Main Repository 
We realize that like everyone, we're not perfect so we'd love to hear constructive feedback. To suggest a change, open a pull request to the main repository and we'll get on it ASAP. **Please DO NOT push directly to the main branch unless permitted to do so.**
